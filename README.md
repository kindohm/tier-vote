## Code Contribution

Thanks for your interest in contributing to tier-vote! Please follow these guidelines to make collaboration smooth.

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main` using a descriptive name (e.g. `feature/chat-panel`).
- Keep changes focused and split large work into multiple small PRs when possible.
- Follow the existing TypeScript + React patterns used in this repo:
  - Data access and real-time subscriptions live in `src/lib/` as hooks (e.g. `useVotes.ts`, `useChat.ts`).
  - Reusable UI components live in `src/lib/components/` and use Bootstrap + CSS modules or global styles.
  - Pages use the Next.js App Router under `src/app/`.
- Include type definitions for new public functions/components and prefer explicit prop types.
- Run the app locally to verify changes:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

- If you add or modify Firestore security rules, update `firestore.rules` in the repo and include a short explanation in your PR. Deploying rules to the Firebase project is a separate step.

- Tests and linting:

  - If you add tests, include them close to the code being tested (in the same directory)
    and ensure they pass locally.

- PR checklist:
  - Describe the problem and solution in the PR description.
  - Link any related issues.
  - Mention any manual steps needed to verify (e.g., deploy Firestore rules).

We appreciate clear commit messages and thoughtful code reviews. Thanks for helping improve tier-vote!
